#Notes: This program will create project/Tenancy in a Region, create user, assign a role to user:
#Change tenant name/usr/pwd details as provided from admin:
# A Tenant cannot create an external router/subnets without being granted admin privileges.
# Public/external subnets are usually provided by the Provider/Vendor.
